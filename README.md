# Project: AI Code Evaluation System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the ability to:

- Evaluate AI-generated Python code for correctness, efficiency, and readability.
- Solve coding challenges by writing efficient and functional Python solutions.
- Write robust test cases to confirm correctness and performance.
- Provide human-readable rationales for evaluations.
- Compare and improve AI-generated solutions.

## Key Features
- Evaluate multiple AI-generated solutions for a single problem.
- Measure execution time and correctness for test cases.
- Provide a summary of which solution is better and why.
- Write instructions for improving a chatbotâ€™s responses.
